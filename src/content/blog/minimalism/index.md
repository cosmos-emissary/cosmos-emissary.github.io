## Minimalist adventure Day 0
I have chosen to be a minimalist person because nothing gives me pleasure. Is that important, Idk. But I know that I have to do this. Anyway lets roll out!

## Make To Do List
I'm using *** for this step because it's perfect, minimal and... anyway. I can do this on my site, which is really important. I set 4 to do because I am becoming minimalist.


## Set Goal for 7 Days 

I'm using *** for set my goal. And this is very efficient. Since it is a 7-day challenge, it is necessary to plan each day separately. That's why I used the *** application.

## Delete everything unnecessary

1. I choose the best distribution for minimalism. No other app, no other website. Just what I want.
2. Add extension for focus your what I want.
3. Toggle to dumb phone
4. Clean the your room or working environment
5. Delete unnecessary in your brain.
