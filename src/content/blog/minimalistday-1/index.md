## Minimalist adventure Day 1
Hello my friend. Welcome to real world! Yeah I feel like this. It didn't work out the way I planned. I just went to the gym. I couldn't do the rest. It wasn't like this in the videos I watched. Reminds me of the saying ‘Welcome to the real world’ because the real life is not video or fiction. Anyway lets write something.![enter image description here](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/20/multimedia/19transformersone-review-hqgp/19transformersone-review-hqgp-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg)
## Couldn't get out of my comfort zone
My comfort zone is my room and couldn't get out it. I can, but I can't. How is that possible. My body ignores my will. Forget it.

### I couldn't my goal

- [ ] Analyse all trials
